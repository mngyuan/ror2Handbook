        "Notes": "The attack takes 2 seconds to fully charge. This scales with attack speed, so for the default 0.96 attack speed the actual value is a little over 2 seconds.\nThe damage it deals depends on the duration percent charged for. However, even if released too early, there is a minimum value of 17.5% for the charge, while over 85% it is actually set to 100%.\nThe laser suffers from default damage falloff.\nThe laser has a base duration of 4 seconds, which is increased based on the number of bonus stocks of Lunar Spikes Growth grants. See the Growth section for more details.\nThis is not affected by the bonus stocks from \nBackup Magazine\n.\nCharging up the attack does not increase the duration of the attack, only its damage output per tick.\nThe laser fires 12 times per second, which is modified by 30% of the difference between False Son's current attack speed vs his base attack speed, which is 0.8.\nWith the default 4 Lunar Spikes, his attack speed is 0.96 and therefore he fires 12.048 times per second.\nItems that negatively affect one's attack speed, such as \nLight Flux Pauldron\n and \nTonic Affliction\n also have less of a negative impact due to the 30% coefficient.\nBug: The bonus firing frequency accumulates with each usage until the game is restarted. If the player uses this skill for a prolonged period of time with a high Growth value, it will eventually have a noticeable effect.\nWhile the firing frequency is capped at 60 due to the engine running at 60 fps, this would still yield 10500% damage per second.\nBoth when charging and firing the laser, False Son moves at 55% speed.\nOne Lunar Spike stock is regained every second.\nThis is not increased with Growth nor does it need the laser to be actively hitting at a target.\nFiring the laser will reset its cooldown, which is relevant when carrying \nLysate Cells\n.\nAdditionally, while normally the skill's cooldown begins when the laser ends, with this item the cooldown begins once the laser starts firing instead.\nFalse Son's primary cancels this skill."

        "Notes": "Stunning\n.\nAfter a grace period of 1.8 seconds, Seeker takes 5% of her max health as damage every 0.2 seconds. This is further decreased by her natural armor and any other damage-reduction method, particularly \nRepulsion Armor Plate\n. This can make Sojourn flight much safer in a similar way to reducing the self-damaging effects of \nHelfire Tincture\n.\nThe damage is dealt relative to Seeker's Base HP + Level HP, ignoring shields, barrier, or any other health-increasing items.\nIf Seeker ever drops below 15% of max health after the grace period, she will immediately exit Sojourn.\nAfter the grace period, the blast damage increases by 500% every second.\nThe blast radius initially starts at 5m and grows hyperbolically towards 20m. Both of these values are increased by 0.5m and 1.5m respectively for each \n Tranquility\n stack. The final blast radius is 110% of what the previous value is at that moment in time when Seeker exits the mode.\nAfter the grace period, every second of flight cuts your healing by 10% until 10 seconds of flight, at which point you receive 0% healing from all sources. The game will always round it to 1, but no health is actually gained. This means that after a certain point, items that reduce, mitigate, or otherwise negate damage will be the only viable methods of extending Sojourn.\nWhile in Sojourn, you can not activate your equipment under any circumstances (even if Seeker has a \nGesture of the Drowned\n in her inventory).\nSojourn can end prematurely if the player collides with any terrain.\nWhile in Sojourn, you are \n immune to damage\n from most damages, even including the Void Fog and the implosion effects of \n \n \n \n Void monsters.\nTwo notable exceptions to this is \nDelayed Damage\n and the Voidling's Nullifier Black Hole.\nUnlike Mercenary's \n Hidden Invincibility\n, this immunity also includes Interactables that cost health, such as Shrine of Blood, Void Cradle and Void Potential.\nSimilar to most mobility skills, when using Sojourn, Seeker is considered to be 'sprinting', this creates some strong synergies with certain sprint based items.\nRose Buckler\n will reduce some of the self-inflicted damage due to the armor it grants.\nLittle Disciple\n can still fire tracking wisps throughout the duration of the ability.\nSojourn has a strong synergy with \nRazorwire\n due to the rapidly inflicted self-damage.\nThis is further enhanced when using the alternate secondary skill, Soul Spiral, allowing Seeker to prolong the duration of Sojourn due to the barrier provided on each orb hit."

Once the 7th Tranquility has been obtained and the power to Revive allies and bless them with Saving Grace has been reached, a green flash of energy in the shape of blooming Lotus Blossom petals bursts forth from Seeker. Seeker can be revived by her passive ability after this point, and any subsequent use of Meditate will Revive dead allies who are eligible for Revive.\nIf Seeker is revived, she retains any Tranquility stacks she had prior to death.

While it is corrupted, the inverse is true, and Corruption depletes over time.\nTaking damage, landing critical strikes, and possessing void items builds Corruption, while healing will reduce Corruption.\nFor each void item the Void Fiend possesses, its minimum Corruption level is increased by 2%. This makes it corrupt itself faster, but does not make its corrupted duration shorter. Instead, the corruption depletes at a slower rate the more void items it possesses.\nMinimum Corruption can be increased to 100%, which permanently locks the Void Fiend into its corrupted state.\nIncreasing it beyond 100% results in it flickering between the minimum value and 100% with no effect on gameplay.\nCorruption is reset to minimum upon advancing to the next stage.\nReceiving any healing reduces corruption percentage in either state.
