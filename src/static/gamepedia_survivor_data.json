It is independent of distance from the device, though because the direction of the push is directly away from the device, airborne targets (including Railgunner herself) further away are generally pushed more level with the ground than if they are closer.\nBecause the force of the push is based on current velocity, jumping (adding vertical velocity) just before the device detonates results in a stronger push."},{"name":"Polar Field Device","imgUrl":"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/riskofrain2_gamepedia_en/images/3/3f/Polar_Field_Device.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/128?cb=20220302031402","imgName":"Polar Field Device.png","Type":"Utility","Cooldown":"12s","Proc Coefficient":"0.0","Description":"Throw out a device that slows down all nearby enemies and projectiles.","Notes":"Agile\n.\nUnlocked via the Railgunner: Annihilator Challenge.
